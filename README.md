# Eternity
It is a console action-rpg, if I could say so. It was one of my training projects, where I tried to program a fully functional game in one of my fovourite game ganres. And I think I succed in it. I tried to use OOP, to give all in-game characters their own personality.

# Features I implemented
⭐Endless level-up system. Every lvl you achieve, you will upgrade your health and strengh.

⭐Four different biomes. Three of the them are available from the start of the game, the fourth one will be opened if you kill three bosses. There are four biomes, but you can easily add more, all preparatory work is done. Every location has its own short information and enemies, which you can meet only there.

⭐Nine different enemies, three enemies in each location (except the fourth one, it is final location with final boss). Every enemy has his own charasteristics, and pattern of attack. You can easily add more of them.

⭐Four bosses, one for each location. Every boss has his own pattern of attack and unic characteristics.

⭐Random system which will calculate when you meet the boss in location. Once you killed him, you will never meet him again. Biome will be clear from the boss.

⭐You can see if boss is alive in each location, in change location menu.

⭐In first three locations I added randomaser of entry phrases which discribing different situations, when you were attacked by the enemy.

⭐Choose any available biome. You are not chained to only one.

⭐You can run from the battle (if it is not a boss battle) and if you are lucky enough, because there is the system according to it every enemy has his own chance to catch you while you are trying to run from the fight.

⭐In battle menu, you can choose healing menu, to use any potion you have. But if you chaged your mind it is not a problem. You can go back to battle menu, it is allowed.

⭐It is easy to see all potions you have in your bag int healing menu.

⭐There is a shop in game. You can refill your bag with potions, if amount of your money allow you that.

⭐Also different weapon are availbale int the shop. A certain class only sees its own weapon. Example: mage see differents staffs at the shop, but don't see swords or bows.

⭐Once you bought any weapon it will be autoequipped. And if later you will buy another one, the new weapon will replace the old one.

⭐There is an auto-fight function in battle menu. Just select it and a batle will end when you or enemy will die.

⭐enemies and bosses can do critical damage, if you try to run away from them and failed.

# Info
Ofcourse I added some "visuals", to this console project. It is must be more pleasant to play. In conclusion I can say that this game is absolutely correct working and can be traversed from start to finish. There are two point of exiting from this game, one is THE END and the other one is YOU DIED :)
